# ProDigy_InfoTech
Thanking the organisation for providing me opportunity as a cybersecurity intern and provide me opportunity to work on varions tasks.
Welcome to my cybersecurity internship project repository! This space documents hands-on tasks I've completed, focusing on ethical hacking, secure coding, image-based data manipulation, and network traffic analysis. Each module demonstrates practical applications of cybersecurity techniques. 
The tasks include :
Caeser_Cipher Python program;
Pixel_Manipulation_For_Image_Encryption;
Password_Complexity_Checker;
Simple_Keylogger;
Network_packet_sniffer.

-> Caeser_Cipher Python Program:
    This as a very old technique of exchanging information in an encoded form that involve shifting values of alphabets in a word by some integer value so that the information remains encoded while exchanging the data/information.

-> Pixel_manipulation_For_image_Encryption:
   This Project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt the images using pixel transformation technique in python, it uses libraries like numpy and pillow in pyhton to manipulate the pixel data, offering a secure approach to secure image.

-> Password_Complexity_Checker:
   A Python based tool that evaluates the strength of user password in real time.it checks essential security criteria such as length, character variety, and special symbols that helps users to create a strong and a secure password.

-> Simple_Keylogger Code:
   This project involves how to capture keyboard input using Python and "pynut" library. It logs keystrokes to a local drive for educational and ethical hacking practice.

-> Network_Packet_Sniffer tool:
   A python  based tool that is used to capture and analyze network packets in real time using "Scapy". Designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes, this tool helps to understand network traffic, protocols, and packet structures.
